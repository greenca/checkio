# You are given a message. You need to pick out all words (a consecutive
# sequence of letters or a single letter), calculate the "likeness"
# coefficients with other words, take an average of them and choose the
# greatest. Count "likeness" coefficient even for the same words (of
# course it's 100). If several words have the same resulting value, then
# choose the word closest to the end of the message. Words in the
# message can be separated by whitespaces and punctuation. There are no
# numbers.
# "Likeness" coefficient for two words is measured in percentages using
# the following rules:
# - Letter case does not matter ("A" == "a");
# - If the first letters of the words are equal, then add 10%;
# - If the last letters of the words are equal, then add 10%;
# - Add length comparison as 
# (length_of_word1 / length_of_word2) * 30%, if length_of_word1 â‰¤ length_of_word2;
# , else (length_of_word2 / length_of_word1) * 30%
# - Take all unique letters from the both words in one set and count how
#   many letters appear in the both words. Add to the coefficient
#   (common_letter_number / unique_letters_numbers) * 50;
# Input: A message as a string (unicode)
# Output: The keyword as a string.
# Precondition:
# 0 < len(message)
# all(x in (string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + " ") for x in message)
