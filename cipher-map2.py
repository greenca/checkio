# A cipher grille is a 4Ã—4 square of paper with four windows cut
# out. Placing the grille on a paper sheet of the same size, the encoder
# writes down the first four symbols of his password inside the windows
# (see fig. below). After that, the encoder turns the grille 90 degrees
# clockwise. The symbols written earlier become hidden under the grille
# and clean paper appears inside the windows. The encoder then writes
# down the next four symbols of the password in the windows and turns
# the grille 90 degrees again. Then, they write down the following four
# symbols and turns the grille once more. Lastly, they write down the
# final four symbols of the password.
# The cipher grille and the ciphered password are represented as an
# array (tuple) of strings.
# Input: A cipher grille and a ciphered password as a tuples of strings.
# Output: The password as a string.
