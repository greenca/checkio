# You are given a pattern as a positive integer and a command as a
# word. For the comparison, the drone should convert the integer pattern
# into binary form, append zeros to left for the command length and
# compare this combination with the command.
# 1 is a letter. 0 is a digit.
# If the pattern and the command are coincided, then return True, else
# -- False. If pattern is longer than a command, then they are not
# coincided (For example - 8 = 1000 and "a").
# Input: Two arguments. A pattern as a positive integer and a command as
# a string.
# Output: Is the pattern coincide with the command or not as a boolean.
# Precondition: 0 â‰¤ pattern < 231
# 0 < len(command) < 32
# "command" contains only ASCII letters or digits.
