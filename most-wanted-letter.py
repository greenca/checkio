# You are given a text, which contains different english letters and
# punctuation symbols. You should find the most frequent letter in the
# text. The letter returned must be in lower case.
# While checking for the most wanted letter, casing does not matter, so
# for the purpose of your search, "A" == "a". Make sure you do not count
# punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces, only letters.
# If you have two or more letters with the same frequency, then return
# the letter which comes first in the latin alphabet. For example --
# "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each, thus we choose "e".
# Input: A text for analysis as a string (unicode for py2.7).
# Output: The most frequent letter in lower case as a string.
# Precondition:
# A text contains only ASCII symbols.
# 0 < len(text) â‰¤ 105
