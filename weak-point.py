# The durability map is represented as a matrix with digits. Each number
# is the durability measurement for the cell. To find the weakest point
# we should find the weakest row and column. The weakest point is placed
# in the intersection of these rows and columns. Row (column) durability
# is a sum of cell durability in that row (column). You should find
# coordinates of the weakest point (row and column). The first row
# (column) is 0th row (column). If a section has several equal weak
# points, then choose the top left point.
# Input: A durability map as a list of lists with integers.
# Output: The coordinates of the weak point as a list (tuple) of
# integers.
# Precondition:
# 0 < len(matrix) â‰¤ 10
# all(len(row) == len(matrix) for row in matrix)
# all(all(0 < x < 10 for x in row) for row in matrix)
