# A pawn is generally a weak unit, but we have 8 of them which we can
# use to build a pawn defense wall. With this strategy, one pawn defends
# the others. A pawn is safe if another pawn can capture a unit on that
# square. We have several white pawns on the chess board and only white
# pawns. You should design your code to find how many pawns are safe.
# You are given a set of square coordinates where we have placed white
# pawns. You should count how many pawns are safe.
# Input: Placed pawns coordinates as a set of strings.
# Output: The number of safe pawns as a integer.
# Precondition:
# 0 < pawns â‰¤ 8
